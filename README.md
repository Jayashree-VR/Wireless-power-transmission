## Working Principle  

1. **Generation of Magnetic Field:**  
   The transmitter circuit uses an oscillator to produce high-frequency alternating current (AC). This AC energizes the primary coil, creating an alternating magnetic field around it.  

2. **Induction of Voltage:**  
   When the secondary coil (receiver) is placed within the magnetic field of the primary coil, electromagnetic induction occurs. This induces an AC voltage in the secondary coil.  

3. **Energy Transfer:**  
   The induced voltage is used to power a load connected to the receiver. If the load requires DC, a rectifier circuit is employed to convert the received AC into DC.  

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**  
   The alignment of the coils, the distance between them, and the frequency of the AC current significantly impact efficiency.

## Construction Steps  

### Transmitter Circuit  
1. Wind the **primary coil** with insulated copper wire (15 turns - loop - 15 turns).  
2. Connect the transistor:  
   - **Collector:** One end of the primary coil.  
   - **Base:** One end of a 10K ohm resistor; connect the other end of the resistor to the other end of the primary coil.  
   - **Emitter:** Negative terminal of the battery.  
3. Connect the loop portion of the primary coil to the positive terminal of the battery.  

### Receiver Circuit  
1. Wind the **secondary coil** with insulated copper wire (30 turns).  
2. Connect the coil to a load (e.g., LED).  

### Testing the Setup  
1. Position the secondary coil close to the primary coil.  
2. Power the transmitter circuit and observe the load lighting up or functioning.
